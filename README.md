# Practice repo to start learning Git`

- git init: Create a new git repo
- git status - Compare working
- git add - Add to staging
- git commit
- git config: Set or get configuration
- git log: Show history (aka "log' ) of project commits`
- git checkout : Checkout branch
- git merge : Merge changes

# Merging
Merging means to bring the changes from one branch to other

- A fast-forward merge happens when the target branch was made from the current one and there are no new changes to the current branch since then

- An automatic merge happens when histories have diverged but git is able to reconcile them into one set of changes
